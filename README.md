Add section for pairing/review stuff (like peer code shares, feedback templates, dtr?)

Add section for pd?

Do we want students to answer CFU questions and submit a PR? If so, we can add those to project under appropriate lesson; downside-these questions will have to be maintained; students COULD create their own CFU md and still submit a PR so that way if questions in lesson plan change, students will just follow the lesson for the guide


Do associated ruby exercises stay in an exercises directory? Or should all enumerable stuff move to the "lesson" directory?

Double check all lesson repo readmes for removing references to forking/cloning the repo

This is the primary repository you will use throughout module 1 at Turing.
